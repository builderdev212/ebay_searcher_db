# Overview

A small project I made to easily search through ebay listings.
Based on [this blog post](https://dev.to/dmitryzub/scrape-ebay-search-with-python-2h22).

The search you make is saved as a sqlite3 database.
There is no built in data browser, as I used [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/).
